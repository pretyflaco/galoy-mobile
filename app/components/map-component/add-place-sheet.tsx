 * modal. A modal window would take every touch on the screen, and the map
 * above has to stay pannable for the whole time this is open.
 *
 * The name and the category are both required — see `buildPlaceSubmission` for
 * why the category is. Submit stays disabled rather than explaining itself
 * afterwards, since which of the two is missing is visible on the form.
