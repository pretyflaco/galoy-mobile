 *
 * An account holding no mode is settled from the server before anything is pushed: the
 * same wallet may already be Anon on another device, and assuming Enhanced would push
 * that away. Only once a mode is known does a disagreement become a push.
 *
 * Both are driven off stored state rather than off the moment the user picks a mode: the
 * choice is made on screens with no connected SDK to sign with, and a push that fails
 * offline has to happen later anyway. What lands is recorded so the next launch stays
 * quiet, since each Enhanced push costs the server a paid country lookup.
